Collection of projects showcasing my abilities in Data Science. Currently showcased skills: data visualization, AI and ML models, algorithmic problem solving.

N-Queens Project: Worked with a group of ten on a term project for my artificial intelligence class. Worked in a smaller team of four students to develop the code for the solution, and aided the remaining members in writing the report. Implemented the MIN-CONFLICTS algorithm with a min-conflicts heuristic, iteratively solving the n-Queens problem for board sizes up to 100,000 (limited by runtime on laptop: proved within report that solution is scalable to higher values of n). Also implemented the visualization for the solving time graph towards the end of the report, where the solving time in seconds was tracked for various values of n.
