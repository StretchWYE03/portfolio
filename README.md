Collection of projects showcasing my abilities in Data Science. Currently showcased skills: data visualization, AI and ML models, algorithmic problem solving.

## N-Queens Project 
Worked with a group of ten on a term project for my artificial intelligence class. Worked in a smaller team of four students to develop the code for the solution, and aided the remaining members in writing the report. Implemented the MIN-CONFLICTS algorithm with a min-conflicts heuristic, iteratively solving the n-Queens problem for board sizes up to 100,000 (limited by runtime on laptop: proved within report that solution is scalable to higher values of n). Also implemented the visualization for the solving time graph towards the end of the report, where the solving time in seconds was tracked for various values of n.

## NBA Statistics Regression Analysis 
Created an R Markdown notebook showcasing my Regression Analysis skills. Used dataset of NBA player statistics for the 2023-2024 season, and used regular season statistics as explanatory variables to predict playoff scoring averages for some of the league's best players. In addition to linear regression and R programming, showcases data visualization, data cleaning, and exploratory data analysis. Future work on this project will include logistic regression showcases, as well as improvements to visualizations and expanding scope of the project.
